# Coffee Machine Project build in Python

Simple Python Project that simulates in a terminal like fashion how ordering one of 3 coffees would work.

# Program Requirements
1. Print report
2. Check if machine has enough resources (water / milk / coffe)?
3. Process coins
4. Check transaction succesful
5. Make Coffe

# Running the program + expected steps
1. Download and run **Coffee Machine.exe**
2. Choose beverage between espresso / latte / cappuccino
3. Input amount of quaters (25 cents) , dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent)
4. You will receive change based on beverage chosen and amount introduced

# Extra details
Each beverage is composed of water, milk and coffe. A cost is also assigned to the beverage itself. Depending on the amount of money introduced, the program will calculate total sum received and offer to return change if amount introduced is (likely) higher than cost of beverage. 

# Current status:
Code available
Program is executable
Main loop in regards to beverage desired
Calculating change based on amount typed in and returning the beverage
Denial of order if not sufficient money is typed in

What doesn't work (yet?): 
  - Adjusting machine resources based on beverages ordered
  - Printing a Denial Message if there are not sufficient resoureces for a beverage
